    <section name="Launching a Cluster"></section>
    <p>After you install the client scripts and enter your EC2 account information, starting a
    Hadoop cluster with 10 nodes is easy with a single command. 
    <br />
    <br />To launch a cluster called "my-hadoop-cluster" with 10 worker (slave) nodes, use this
    command:</p>
    <source>% hadoop-ec2 launch-cluster my-hadoop-cluster 10</source>
    <p>
    <br />This command boots the master node and 10 worker nodes. The master node runs the
    Namenode, secondary Namenode, and Jobtracker, and each worker node runs a Datanode and a
    Tasktracker.</p>
    <p>Equivalently, you can launch the cluster by using this command syntax:</p>
    <source>% hadoop-ec2 launch-cluster my-hadoop-cluster 1 nn,snn,jt 10 dn,tt</source>
    <p>Note that by using this syntax, you can also launch a split Namenode/Jobtracker cluster. For
    example:</p>
    <source>% hadoop-ec2 launch-cluster my-hadoop-cluster 1 nn,snn 1 jt 10 dn,tt</source>
    <p>After the nodes have started and the Hadoop cluster is operational, the console will display
    a message such as:</p>
    <source>Browse the cluster at http://ec2-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx.compute-1.amazonaws.com/</source>
    <p>You can access Hadoop's web UI at the URL in the message. By default, port 80 is opened for
    access from your client machine. You can change the firewall settings (to allow access from a
    network, rather than just a single machine, for example) by using the Amazon EC2 command line
    tools, or by using a tool such as 
    <a class="externalLink"
    href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=609">Elastic
    Fox</a>. The security group to change is the one named 
    <tt>&lt;cluster-name&gt;-&lt;role&gt;</tt>. For example, for the Namenode in the cluster
    started above, it would be 
    <tt>my-hadoop-cluster-nn</tt>.</p>
    <p>For security reasons, traffic from the network your client is running on is proxied through
    the master node of the cluster using an SSH tunnel (a SOCKS proxy on port 6666).</p>
    <p>To set up the proxy, run the following command:</p>
    <source>% eval `hadoop-ec2 proxy my-hadoop-cluster`</source>
    <p>Note the backticks, which are used to evaluate the result of the command. This allows you to
    stop the proxy later on (from the same terminal):</p>
    <source>% kill $HADOOP_CLOUD_PROXY_PID</source>
    <p>Web browsers need to be configured to use this proxy too, so you can view pages served by
    worker nodes in the cluster. The most convenient way to do this is to use a 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_auto-config">proxy auto-config
    (PAC) file</a>file, such as 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://apache-hadoop-ec2.s3.amazonaws.com/proxy.pac">this
    one</a>for Hadoop EC2 clusters.</p>
    <p>If you are using Firefox, then you may find 
    <a class="externalLink" href="http://foxyproxy.mozdev.org/">FoxyProxy</a>useful for managing
    PAC files.</p>
