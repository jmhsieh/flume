    <section name="Automatically Shutting Down a Cluster"></section>
    <p>You can use the 
    <tt>--auto-shutdown</tt>option to automatically terminate a cluster at a specified number of
    minutes after launch. This is useful for short-lived clusters where the jobs complete in a
    known amount of time.</p>
    <p>
      <b>To configure the automatic shutdown (for example, 50 minutes after launch):</b>
    </p>
    <source>hadoop-ec2 launch-cluster --auto-shutdown 50 my-hadoop-cluster 2</source>
    <p>You can also use the configuration property 
    <tt>auto_shutdown</tt>in the configuration file; for example, to shut down 50 minutes after
    launch, you would use 
    <tt>auto_shutdown=50</tt>.</p>
    <p>
      <b>To cancel the automatic shutdown:</b>
    </p>
    <source>
% hadoop-ec2 exec my-hadoop-cluster shutdown -c 
% hadoop-ec2 update-slaves-file my-hadoop-cluster 
% hadoop-ec2 exec my-hadoop-cluster /usr/lib/hadoop/bin/slaves.sh shutdown -c
</source>
